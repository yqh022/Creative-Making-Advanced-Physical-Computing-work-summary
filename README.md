## Project Proposal
The group members intended to define a design direction, and we each conceived two options for discussion. After the group's exchange we decided to combine three of them for subsequent refinement.![IMG_0779](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119873931/206718742-4cdd40b7-6cfc-46bf-a67e-d885b7bb9e95.JPG)

I thought about three different solutions. One was about the relationship between the machine and nature and people, maybe through the vibration of metal pieces, the second was about Tamagotchi, and the third was about mechanical plants in the future. After discussion, we decided to do something about plant's rebirth.

### Inspiration:
People always want everything around them to exist the way people want it to, and living things including plants are being bound by people's wishes.
### The concept:
Whether machinery can be called "life" when it changes from a tool to assist human beings to a carrier to continue biological life, the process of "rebirth" is the gradual dissolution of a plant's own will, from symbiosis with machinery to its eventual replacement by complete mechanization. The project is an exploration of the possible collision and fusion between machinery and biology in the future, driven by the will of people. In choosing the main object for the installation, we were inspired by David Bowen's botanical installation recommended by our teacher and finally chose plants.
### Keywords: mechanical derivative, future technology, symbiosis
### Enclosure: 
mechanical branches protruding from plant branches, considering the use of dead plant branches hollowed out and connected to wobbling mechanical arms, other branches made entirely of machinery, with a metallic reflective surface
### Affordances: 
The branches connected to the plant sway in the direction of the human as he approaches, while the fully mechanical flowers are close to the human and open with touch rotation.
### Feedback: Feedback may be light, rotation, shaking, etc.
### Possible Input: touchboard, microphones, IR transistors, pressure
### Possible Output: motors, servo, muscle wire, stepper
Then I thought more carefully about the possibility of mechanical plants in the futureï¼š![IMG_0781](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119873931/206721242-f795511b-e300-4a4b-ba06-bc6f94ea9826.JPG)
# week 7:
### Goal this week: 
get a sense of which parts I would need, how I would use them, and get a general sense of how I could bring this project to life.
